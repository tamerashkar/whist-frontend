    <h4><strong>Rules</strong></h4>
    <p>
      Whist, a simple but fun card game, is typically played in pairs with your
      teammate sitting across from you.
    </p>
    <h4><strong>Starting the game</strong></h4>
    <p>
      Each player is dealt 13 cards. The first player to start the round is the
      person the right of the dealer. A round is over after all the players have
      played their cards. After each round, the dealer moves the to right and
      the cards are dealt again.
    </p>
    <h4><strong>Bidding</strong></h4>
    <p>
      Before the round starts, players starting from the right of the dealer bid
      on the number of hands they believe they can win. The player can pass or
      bid the number of hands their team will win. The minimum bid is 7 and
      every player must bid higher than the previous bid with the exception of
      the dealer who can match the highest bid.
    </p>
    <h4><strong>Trump suit</strong></h4>
    <p>
      The bid winner plays the first card. The card that they play determines
      the trump suit. If a player plays the King of Hearts, the trump suit is
      the Heart. The trump suit is more valued than any of the other suits with
      the 2 of the trump suit being higher than the Ace of any other suit.
    </p>
    <h4><strong>Competing</strong></h4>
    <p>
      Each hand a player plays one card and the winner of the hand is determined
      by the highest valued card. The team with the winning card gains a point.
      The winner of this hand plays the first card for the next hand.
    </p>
    <h4><strong>Scoring</strong></h4>
    <p>
      At the end of the round after all the cards are played, if the team with
      the winning bid won enough hands to match their bid, they keep the points.
      Otherwise they lose their bid and if the other team scores at least 7
      points. They keep those points.
    </p>
    <h4><strong>Winning</strong></h4>
    <p>
      After each round, the score is added up. When a team reaches 52 points,
      they win the game. Have fun and good luck!
